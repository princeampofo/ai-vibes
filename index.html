                    History of Artificial Intellligence
                </h3>
                <p class="history">
                    Artificial intelligence (AI) was first coined in 1956, but due to increased data volumes, improved algorithms, and advances in computer power and storage, AI has become more popular in recent years.
                    Problem solving and symbolic approaches were the focus of early AI research in the 1950s.The US Department of Defense became interested in this type of work in the 1960s, and started training computers to emulate fundamental human reasoning. In recent years, Siri , Alexa and Cortana has become popular intelligent personal assistants and we owe this progress to Artificial Intelligence.In the next few years, there will be a lot of AI products on the market and one should definitely look into this field in order to get accustomed to new Tech trends.

                    How does AI work
                </h3>
    
                <p class="history">
                    Vendors have been scrambling to showcase how their products and services integrate AI as the hoopla around AI has grown. What they call AI is frequently just one component of AI, such as machine learning. For designing and training machine learning algorithms, AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software. Although no single programming language is synonymous with AI, a handful stand out, including Python, R, and Java.AI systems, in general, work by consuming huge volumes of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and then using these patterns to forecast future states. For example , by examining millions of examples, a chatbot fed examples of text chats may learn to make lifelike exchanges with people, and an image recognition program can learn to recognize and describe items in photographs. Artificial Intelligence is mainly focused on three cognitive skills which are learning , reasoning and self-correction. The learning process in AI programming is concerned with gathering data and formulating rules for converting that data into useful information. The AI reasoning process on the other hand is concerned with selecting the best algorithm to achieve a given result. Lastly, self-correction is a feature of AI programming that allows algorithms to be fine-tuned over time to ensure that they produce the most accurate results possible.

                    Importance of Artificial Intelligence
                </h3>
    
                <p class="history">
                    Artificial intelligence has a number of everyday implications that are changing the way we live. If a time traveler from the 1950s arrived in 2019, they would be amazed at how we navigate around town with our smartphones, how virtual digital assistants like Alexa and Cortana respond to our questions, and be perplexed by our addiction to social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. What we take for granted now, thanks to AI, would be completely alien to our companion from the past. Artificial intelligence is, without a question, a vital component of our daily life.

                <p class="history">
                    Artificial intelligence isn't simply enhancing people's lives; it's also saving them in some situations. Many businesses, especially IT firms, are investing in and exploring artificial intelligence as a means of improving our healthcare system. AI is changing our healthcare system from its operations to the treatment that these organizations deliver, from working out tailored medicine prescriptions to improved diagnostic tools and even robots to aid in surgeries.Aside from our healthcare systems, AI is anticipated to play a key role in addressing the environmental issues we face as a result of global warming. Artificial Intelligence is indeed changing the world to become a better place.
